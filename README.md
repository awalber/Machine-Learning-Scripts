# Machine-Learning-Scripts
These are a few scripts that I originally wrote in octave as a part of Andrew Ng's course on machine learning. I wanted to make these scripts utilizable in python to show myself that I really understood the topics being conveyed through this course. All data found in this repository are originally used in Andrew Ng's machine learning course.

A separate tensorflow folder was created for the CNN and RNN projects that I worked on.
